If you are new to mobile development, the easiest way to get started is with Expo CLI. Expo is a set of tools built around React Native and, while it has many features, the most relevant feature for us right now is that it can get you writing a React Native app within minutes. You will only need a recent version of Node.js and a phone or emulator. If you'd like to try out React Native directly in your web browser before installing any tools, you can try out Snack.

Assuming that you have Node 10 LTS or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

npm install -g expo-cli
Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

expo init AwesomeProject

cd AwesomeProject
npm start # you can also use: expo start
This will start a development server for you.

to get started, you can type:
cd AwesomeProject
yarn start

Running your React Native application
Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, follow on-screen instructions to get a link.
